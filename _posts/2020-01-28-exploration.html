<p>I was sitting on my couch, as usual working on my laptop; with my so-called work from home internship. I was really bored and with sleepy and suddenly a primary school girl kid from the neighbourhood came to my house. She saw me working on my laptop. She was staring at the rear side of my laptop and started reading:</p> <h3 class="caption text-muted" >" hp" and said, "so p for puneet and then what about the h ?" </h3>
<p> I literally went blank for a while I just wondered what exactly did she want to know about. As I said, she was just a small kid; Mr Hewlett Packard would never have thought to keep the brand name of his name initials which could be questioned like this but he was never wrong. Nowadays initials and short forms are being used more by businesses in thier brands name.</p><p> So, the moral of the story is that if a brand really wants to stand apart they should come with unique names that should be more relevant to the brand's propaganda of just using initials and short adjectives won't work because till the date there are numerous business using only initials in their brand name.</p>

<p class="section-heading">Here are some major key points to note before you start thinking for a great brand name:</p>
<p>&#8226; Whatever brand name you're choosing it should be relevant to your product or business and it should be descriptive.</p>
<p>&#8226; Avoid using initials because till 2019 many brands have been established with their name only consisting initials.</p>
<p>&#8226; prefix suffix, compound words, verbs and trending slangs(if they are relevant to your product) words with a change in spelling but displaying it with creative graphics.</p>
<p>&#8226; At last, also understand you're customer base their age group and targeted audience especially if your business like is news media or Entertainment blog you might be dependent on social media platforms so the name should be easily recalled by the audience example: Speaking tree</p>
